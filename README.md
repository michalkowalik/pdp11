### What is this repository for? ###

* PDP11/70 emulator written in go
* It's still a very early stage - pretty much nothing works yet, and that's OK - I'll get there.

### quick summary ###

- a PDP11/70 emulator like many others, but this time in Golang.
- The plan is to use a simplified Forth interpreter as a replacement for the PDP hardware console, to achieve the following:
  - halt
  - start
  - step
  - boot
  - show registers
  - modify registers
  - mount / unmount drives
  - dump memory image

### How do I get set up? ###

* clone repo
* `go install pdp`
